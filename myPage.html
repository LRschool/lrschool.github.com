     <center> <p class="quote">"True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life. Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived. Yoga doesn’t care about what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming. Yoga is designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called yoga, its essence must be embodied".</p></center>

      <center><h5>Explenation</h5></center>
     <center> <h4>Yoga is one of my extra curricular activities. I practice yoga as a form of exercise and as a method to  alleviate stress.  I am not spiritual or religious but I support the messages that yoga promotes such as staying grounded, respecting your body, and staying with your breath. In my eyes yoga is a way of making a better home for your “soul” to live in. Without it I feel I would be a much less complete and content person.</h4></center>
