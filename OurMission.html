   <center><h5> I recieve 4's on a good amount of my annotations because of the amount of effort and analysis I put into them. the images above are examples of this.</h5></center>
    
    <center><p>Annotation 1. was about how america was a melting pot for all nationalities. America being a land of immigrants created an entirely new race as a result of cross breeding between ethnicities. Annotation 2. spoke of how the revolution changed every established dynamic in the U.S. this included religious freedom becoming more apparent, slavery beggining it's journey to irradication, and women becoming slightly more respected. Annotations 3./4. were about the structure of governement present in the constitution. each state would have two members of senate and their number of house reperasentatives was determined by their population. </p></center>
