      <h2><center>Smart Goal</center></h2>
      <center><h4>My smart goal for the 2019-2020 school year was inspired by my stretch, which is punctuation. because of this my Smart Goal was to improve my punctuation. By the end of the year I wanted to feel confident in the fact that I could easily and accurately punctuate an essay or piece of writing. I love writing and pride myself on my literary work, but I would often get marked down on assignments for incorrect punctuation.</h4></center>
      
      <h6><center>Do you feel your stretch is still a stretch? Or is it becoming more of a strength?</center></h6>
      
      <center><h4>I feel that my stretch is on the brink of no longer being a stretch. It has improved significantly since the beginning of the year, but still remains a minor struggle. One example of this is that I no longer get marked down for incorrect punctuation, but there are still some rules of punctuation that I do not fully understand. I do not believe it has become a strength yet, but I can somewhat correct a classmate's punctuation. In my pursuit of perfect punctuation I have discovered that it is something many students of my generation struggle with. This is most likely due to grammar and punctuation not being taught as readily these days, as opposed to twenty years ago when students were expected to have these literary rules ingrained in their minds.</h4></center>
      
      <h2><center>Strength</center></h2>
      
      <h4><center>One of my most prominent strengths is analysis. My ability to examine literary pieces and understand what is being inferred in the writing has greatly aided me when reading The Scarlet Letter, The Odyssey, and annotating Give me Liberty. This strength allows me to incorporate aspects others may not have considered into my writing, and enrich class discussions on what we have read (whether they be novels or historical documents). </center></h4>
      
      <h6><center>Give an example of a project, assignment or moment where you feel you used your strength effectively.</center></h6>
      
      <h4><center>One particular assignment in which I used my ability to analyze was The Scarlet Letter essay. From the six prompts we were given to choose from I chose “Should The Scarlet Letter be considered a Psychological novel?” This essay took a large amount of analysis considering I had to dissect and explain every psychological concept present in the novel. Of course I didn’t explain all of them, but I went into those that were most significant. My final ruling was that it should be considered a psychological novel because of how deeply psychological the major themes are in the book. Furthermore, the book being written in 1850, before psychological novels existed, makes it revolutionary in the literary world. The habit of mind that this is an example of is critical thinking.</center></h4>
      
      <h2><center>Q & A'S</center></h2>
      
      <h5><center>How Broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted? What have you done to improve the social atmosphere?</center></h5>
    
      
      <h4><center>My friend group is fairly broad, but I am not “good” friends with many people. I am open to being friends with anyone, but the extent to which I connect with them is dependent on the individual. I am friends with a good amount of the boys in our grade, which I think has improved the social atmosphere by helping to bridge the gender gap.</center></h4>
      
      <h5><center>What kinds of leadership roles have you assumed this year? How have you grown as a leader?</center></h5>
      
      <h4><center>One event that pushed me to grow as a leader was organizing a bake sale to raise money for Water For South Sudan. In order to execute the bake sale I had people sign up to bring pies and ice cream to sell, designed flyers for the cause and made twelve gallons of apple cider. I did so while being sick and having to balance it with writing our Scarlet Letter essay. The bake sale was successful in the end though and raised a decent amount of money for a good cause. The habits of mind this showcases are Initiative and self direction as well as communication and collaboration.</center></h4>
      
      <h5><center>Are you consistent with completing work on time? What is hindering/helping you?</center></h5>
      
      <h4><center>I turn the majority of my assignments in on time, unless I have been absent. I would say that stress is the most significant thing that both hinders me and helps me, in regards to this. Stress pushes me to do my assignments when I get them, which stops me from procrastinating and thus leads me to turning them in on time. I do this because I am unable to relax if I have an assignment hanging over my head. At the same time though, this means that when I have a large amount of assignments due I can become overwhelmed by the amount of stress I experience. As a result of this, the same stress that once aided me becomes crippling and negatively affects the clarity I need to complete assignments. Keeping my stress levels under control this year has been a challenge, but I believe the early experience of having to cope with stress and finding ways to maintain it will help me when I go to high school and college. The habits of mind I believe were present when tackling this struggle were initiative, self-direction, and problem solving.</center></h4>
      
      <h5><center>Think about assignments, projects, tests you’ve completed. What are you most proud of, what pieces reflect effort and resilience? Which Habits of Mind are easily identifiable In these pieces? </center></h5>
      
      <h4><center>The project I am most proud of is my science fair project. It took an immense amount of work, research, and effort and was an amazing experience. I feel that both last year and this year’s science fairs have made me grow as a student more than anything. This year especially I had to take initiative to complete my project to the best of my ability. Unlike last year’s science fair ,in which I had a partner, this year I could not rely on anyone else to complete the work that had to be done, and I was not able to split-up the workload. In the end I was very pleased with my project and got first place at the GSDEF and Runner-up sweepstakes. I am very proud of this, because I did it on my own. The Habits of Mind this project exemplifies are critical thinking, problem solving, initiative, self-direction, accuracy, and precision.</center></h4>
